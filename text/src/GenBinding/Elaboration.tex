\chapter{Elaboration}\label{ch:elaboration}
Programming language mechanizations typically rely on many boilerplate
properties of the boilerplate operations that we introduced in the previous
section. To further reduce the hand-written boilerplate, we have set up the
\Knot specification language in such a way that it provides all the necessary
information to generically state and prove a wide range of these
properties.

%% \footnote{In fact, we provide more such lemmas than any other framework based on
%%   first-order representations -- see Section~\ref{sec:related}.}

Below we discuss different kinds of ubiquitous lemmas that \Needle covers;
Appendix~\ref{app:lemmas} provides more detail. In general, it is quite
challenging to tackle these boilerplate lemmas generically because their exact
statements, and in particular which premises are needed, depend highly on the
dependencies between sorts and of the associated data in environments.
