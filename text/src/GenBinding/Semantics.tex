\chapter{Semantics}\label{ch:knotsemantics}

The previous chapter has introduced the \Knot~specification language for
abstract syntax. This chapter generically defines the semantics of \Knot in
terms of a de Bruijn representation. We assume a given and fixed well-formed
specification $\spec$ in the rest of this chapter. The discussion follows these
consecutive steps:

Section \ref{sec:semantics} declares \emph{de Bruijn syntax terms} for \Knot's
\emph{abstract syntax declarations} of the given specification and specifies
which are well-sorted and well-scoped with respect to the specification. It also
defines the \emph{semantics of binding specifications} by means of evaluation.
\emph{Evaluation of expressions} is the topic of Section
\ref{sec:exprsemantics}. A dependency of evaluation is the definition of
boilerplate \emph{shiftings and substitutions function} that operate on terms.
These are also defined in Section \ref{sec:exprsemantics}. The
\emph{interpretation of relation specifications} is discussed in Section
\ref{sec:relationsemantics} including boilerplate \emph{environment lookup
  relations}.
