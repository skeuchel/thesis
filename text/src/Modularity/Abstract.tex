Formal reasoning in proof assistants, also known as mechanization, has high
development costs. Building modular reusable components is a key issue in
reducing these costs. A stumbling block for reuse is that inductive definitions
and proofs are closed to extension. This is a manifestation of the expression
problem that has been addressed by the Meta-Theory \`a la Carte (MTC) framework
in the context of programming language meta-theory.
However, MTC's use of extensible
Church-encodings is unsatisfactory.

This paper takes a better approach to the problem with datatype-generic
programming (DGP). It applies well-known DGP techniques to represent modular
datatypes, to build functions from functor algebras with folds and to compose
proofs from proof algebras by means of induction. Moreover, for certain
functionality and proofs our approach can achieve more reuse than MTC: instead
of composing modular components we provide a single generic definition once and
for all.
