Formally mechanizing proofs can be very tedious and the amount of work
required for larger developments is excruciating. Meta-Theory \`a la Carte
is a framework for modular reusable components for use in
mechanizations. It builds on the Datatypes \`a la Carte approach to solve
an extended version of the expression problem. MTC allows modular
definitions of datatypes, semantic functions and logical relations and
furthermore modular inductive proofs.

MTC uses extensible Church-encodings to overcome conservative restrictions
imposed by the Coq proof-assistant. This approach has shortcomings
in terms of confidence in the definitions and in terms of usability. This
paper addresses these shortcomings by using datatype-generic
programming techniques to replace Church-encodings as the underlying representation
of type-level fixed points. Our approach avoids impredicativity, adequately
encodes fixed points and leads to stronger induction principles by
exploiting DGP approaches that capture only strictly-positive functors.

Working with generic structure representation has the added benefit that
we can implement generic functions like equality and generic proofs once and for all.
